Development setup
=================

Install npm, ruby and java. Have them in your path.
For windows it's easiest to use cygwin.


Prepare the project
-------------------

```bash
cd $webplayer_directory
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
gem install sass
gem install compass
mkdir node_modules/grunt-closure-compiler/build
pushd node_modules/grunt-closure-compiler/build
wget https://dl.google.com/closure-compiler/compiler-latest.zip
7z x compiler-latest.zip
mv closure-compiler*jar compiler.jar
rm compiler-latest.zip
popd
```


Build the project
-----------------

Build the project with:

```bash
grunt
```

The results will be stored in the output directory:

* `output/release` - the compiled scripts, styles and html documentation with embedded images
* `output/site` - the HTML, JavaScript and CSS parts that are to be copied to a web server for demonstration. They lack the media files that are supposed to be on the server in the `media` subdirectory. 
* `output/devel` - the HTML, JavaScript and CSS parts that are to be used on a local server for development. They lack the media files that are supposed to be on the server on the prefix dictated by 

There are a few sub targets if you do not want to rebuild everything. The most interesting are:

* `grunt docs` rebuilds the documentation,
* `grunt build` rebuilds and recompiles the JavaScript and CSS files,
* `grunt release` builds the release zip,
* `grunt sass` rebuilds just CSS,
* `grunt debug` rebuilds the CSS and unminified JavaScript output, without compiling it.




Issue tracking
--------------

The project has two issue trackers, a public one (GitLab) with issues marked as #NNN and a legacy private one (Redmine) with issues marked as redmine-NNN
